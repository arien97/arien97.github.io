                <p>My name is Arien and I'm a senior at BU studying biology and computer science! I grew up in Cambridge, MA, which is very close to BU.
                    As of right now, I am a part-time student and I'm taking
                CS506 as well as CS501. My plan after graduation is to be able to work in industry as a software engineer,
                however I am open to other pathways that may interest me.</p>
